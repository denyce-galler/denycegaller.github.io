    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p id="text">Hi, I’m Denyce and I am a software developer. I have a background in nursing and I have passion for front end technologies that improve user experience. 
      I got into tech because I saw the work that my family and friends who work in tech produced. 
      One of the people that inspired me the most was my mum who is a programmer for BNZ. She was one of the people that helped develop paywave for iphones. 
      I remember being not only really proud of her – but also really fascinated especially after hearing her share the difficulties they faced making this possible. 
      It made me deeply reflect on technologies we us</p>
